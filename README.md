# duphold: uphold your DUP and DEL calls

SV callers like [lumpy](https://github.com/arq5x/lumpy) look at split-reads and pair distances to find structural variants.
This tool is a fast way to add depth information to those calls. This can be used as additional
information for filtering variants; for example **we will be skeptical of deletion calls that
do not have lower than average coverage** compared to regions with similar gc-content.

In addition, `duphold` will annotate the SV vcf with information from a SNP/Indel VCF. For example, **we will not
believe a large deletion that has many heterozygote SNP calls**.


`duphold` takes a **bam/cram**, a **VCF/BCF** of SV calls, and a **fasta** reference and it updates the FORMAT field for a
single sample with:

+ **DHFC**: fold-change for the variant depth *relative to the rest of the chromosome* the variant was found on
+ **DHBFC**: fold-change for the variant depth *relative to bins in the genome with similar GC-content*.
+ **DHFFC**: fold-change for the variant depth *relative to **F**lanking regions*.

It also adds **GCF** to the INFO field indicating the fraction of G or C bases in the variant.

After annotating with `duphold`, a sensible way to filter to high-quality variants is:

```
bcftools view -i '(SVTYPE = "DEL" & FMT/DHFFC[0] < 0.7) | (SVTYPE = "DUP" & FMT/DHBFC[0] > 1.3)" $svvcf

```

In our evaluations, `DHFFC` works best for deletions and `DHBFC` works slightly better for duplications.
For genomes/samples with more variable coverage, `DHFFC` should be the most reliable.


## SNP/Indel annotation

**NOTE** it is strongly recommended to use BCF for the `--snp` argument as otherwise VCF parsing will be a bottleneck.

+ A DEL call with many HETs is unlikely to be valid.

When the user specifies a `--snp` VCF, `duphold` finds the appropriate sample in that file and extracts high (> 20) quality, bi-allelic
SNP calls. For each chromosome, it will store a minimal (low-memory representation) in a sorted data-structure for fast access. It will
then query this data structure for each SV and count the number of hom-refs, heterozygote, hom-alt, unknown, and low-quality snp calls
in the region of the event. 
This information is stored in 5 integers in `DHGT`.

When a SNP/Indel VCF/BCF is given, `duphold` will annotate each DEL/DUP call with:

+ **DHGT**: counts of [0] Hom-ref, [1] Het, [2] Homalt, [3] Unknown, [4] low-quality variants in the event.
  A heterozygous deletion may have more hom-alt SNP calls. A homozygous deletion may have only unknown or
  low-quality SNP calls.

In practice, this has had limited benefit for us. The depth changes are more informative.

## Performance

### Speed

`duphold` runtime depends almost entirely on how long it takes to parse the BAM/CRAM files; it is relatively independent of the number of variants evaluated. It will also run quite a bit faster on CRAM than on BAM. It can be < 20 minutes of CPU time for a 30X CRAM.

### Accuracy

Evaluting on the [genome in a bottle truthset](ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/giab/ftp/data/AshkenazimTrio/analysis/NIST_SVs_Integration_v0.6/HG002_SVs_Tier1_v0.6.vcf.gz) for *DEL calls larger than 300 bp*:

| method      |   FDR |   FN |   FP |   TP-call |   precision |   recall |   recall-% |    FP-% |
|:------------|------:|-----:|-----:|----------:|------------:|---------:|-----------:|--------:|
| unfiltered  | 0.054 |  276 |   86 |      1496 |       0.946 |    0.844 |    100.000 | 100.000 |
| DHBFC < 0.7 | 0.018 |  298 |   27 |      1474 |       0.982 |    0.832 |     98.529 |  31.395 |
| DHFFC < 0.7 | 0.021 |  289 |   32 |      1483 |       0.979 |    0.837 |     99.131 |  37.209 |


Note that filtering on `DHFFC < 0.7` **retains  99.1% of true positives** and **removes  62.8% (100 - 37.2) of false positives**

This was generated using [truvari.py](https://github.com/spiralgenetics/truvari) with the command:
```
truvari.py --sizemax 15000000 -s 300 -S 270 -b HG002_SVs_Tier1_v0.6.DEL.vcf.gz -c $dupholded_vcf -o $out \
   --passonly --pctsim=0  -r 20 --giabreport -f $fasta --no-ref --includebed HG002_SVs_Tier1_v0.6.bed -O 0.6
```

For **deletions >= 1KB**, duphold does even better:

| method      |   FDR |   FN |   FP |   TP-call |   precision |   recall |   recall-% |    FP-% |
|:------------|------:|-----:|-----:|----------:|------------:|---------:|-----------:|--------:|
| unfiltered  | 0.073 |   46 |   38 |       486 |       0.927 |    0.914 |    100.000 | 100.000 |
| DHBFC < 0.7 | 0.012 |   54 |    6 |       478 |       0.988 |    0.898 |     98.354 |  15.789 |
| DHFFC < 0.7 | 0.012 |   53 |    6 |       479 |       0.988 |    0.900 |     98.560 |  15.789 |

Note that filtering on `DHFFC < 0.7` **retains 98.5% of DEL calls that are also in the truth-set (TPs)** and
**removes 84.2% (100 - 15.8) of calls not in the truth-set (FPs)**

The `truvari.py` command used for this is the same as above except for: `-s 1000 -S 970`

## Install

`duphold` is distributed as a binary [here](https://github.com/brentp/duphold/releases/latest) and requires libhts.so in standard locations or indicated with `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.



## Usage

```
duphold -s $gatk_vcf -t 4 -v $svvcf -b $cram -f $fasta -o $output.bcf
duphold --snp $gatk_bcf --threads 4 --vcf $svvcf --bam $cram --fasta $fasta --output $output.bcf
```

`--snp` can be a multi-sample VCF/BCF. `duphold` will be much faster with a BCF, especially if
the snp/indel file contains many (>20 or so) samples.

the threads are decompression threads so increasing up to about 4 works.

Full usage is available with `duphold -h`

## Examples

#### Duplication

Here is a duplication with clear change in depth (`DHBFC`)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/45895409-5a224080-bd8e-11e8-844f-e7ffc13c7972.png "example IGV screenshot")

`duphold` annotated this with

+ **DHBFC**: 1.79

where together these indicate rapid (DUP-like) change in depth at the break-points and a coverage that 1.79 times higher than the mean for the genome--again indicative of a DUP. Together, these recapitulate (or anticipate) what we see on visual inspection.

#### Deletion

A clear deletion will have rapid drop in depth at the left and increase in depth at the right and a lower mean coverage.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/45895721-2dbaf400-bd8f-11e8-88b3-9fd5a90ef39e.png)

`duphold` annotated this with:

+ **DHBFC**: 0.6

These indicate that both break-points are consistent with a deletion and that the coverage is ~60% of expected. So this is a clear deletion.

#### BND

when lumpy decides that a cluster of evidence does not match a DUP or DEL or INV, it creates a BND with 2 lines in the VCF. Sometimes these
are actual deletions. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1739/45906495-987d2700-bdb1-11e8-8ba5-eacdf8221f68.png)

shows where a deletion is bounded by 2 BND calls. `duphold` annotates this with:

+ **DHBFC**: 0.01

indicating a homozygous deletion with clear break-points.


## Tuning and Env vars

The default flank is 1000 bases. If the environment variable `DUPHOLD_FLANK` is set to an integer, that
can be used instead. In our experiments, this value should be large enough that duphold can get a good estimate
of depth, but small enough that it is unlikely to extend into an unmapped region or another event.
This may be lowered for genomes with poor assemblies.

If the sample name in your bam does not match the one in the VCF (tisk, tisk). You can use `DUPHOLD_SAMPLE_NAME`
environment variable to set the name to use.

I stole the idea of annotating SVs with depth-change from Ira Hall.
